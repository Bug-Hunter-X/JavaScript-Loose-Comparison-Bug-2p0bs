This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison (==). The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js offers the corrected version using strict comparison (===).  The issue arises from JavaScript's type coercion during loose comparison, leading to unexpected results in certain scenarios.  The solution emphasizes the importance of using strict equality to avoid such pitfalls.
